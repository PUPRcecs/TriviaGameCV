We will be using the original “Trivia Game” by Jonathan Torres and Christian Santana as a base for the development of the new program. It will feature a designed user interface (if time allows) that will give feedback to the user and feature input validation. The code itself will feature all the necessary requirements stated by the lab professor. The new implementations to the program will be:

    Photo capturing of the player using Open-CV libraries for the avatar selection.
    In-game sounds that will complete the gaming experience for the user
    Expand the question selection implementing a database that will gather up the files and keep an archive of  the questions for the program. 
        The questions will be selected randomly using the "time" library.
    Math questions will be added and will require user input for each question.
